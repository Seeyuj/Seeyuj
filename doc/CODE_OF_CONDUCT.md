## Purpose

This project aims to provide an **open-source infrastructure for simulating persistent sandbox worlds**, maintainable in the long term.

This code of conduct aims to ensure:
- constructive technical exchanges;
- a respectful and professional collaboration environment;
- protection of the project's vision, architecture, and maintainers.

Participation in the project implies acceptance of these rules.

---

## General Principles

### Respect and Professionalism

All interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews, comments) must remain:

- respectful;
- factual;
- solution-oriented;
- focused on technical and architectural content.

Personal attacks, contempt, aggressive irony, or judgments about others' intentions or skills are not tolerated.

---

### Technical Disagreements

Disagreements are normal and expected in an infrastructure project.

They must:
- be based on technical, measurable, or architectural arguments;
- remain impersonal;
- respect the project's fundamental principles.

A technical disagreement is never a personal attack.

---

### Responsible Communication

Contributors must understand that:

- maintainers contribute on their own time;
- there is no obligation for immediate response;
- no contribution is guaranteed to be accepted;
- no public roadmap is contractual.

Any attempt at pressure, repeated insistence, or circumvention of governance decisions is contrary to the project's spirit.

---

## Unacceptable Behaviors

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- personal attacks or insinuations;
- harassment, intimidation, or provocation;
- ideological or activist debates unrelated to the project;
- public and repeated challenge of governance decisions;
- attempts to force a technical direction through volume or insistence;
- polluting discussions with off-topic content or proposals manifestly incompatible with the project's vision.

---

## Governance and Project Authority

This project is open-source, but **not without governance**.

Maintainers:
- are guarantors of the vision and architecture;
- validate or reject contributions;
- arbitrate technical disagreements.

A contribution may be rejected:
- even if it is technically correct;
- even if it is popular;
- without obligation to propose an alternative;
- without prolonged debate.

Decisions are made in the interest of the project in the long term, not to satisfy an immediate consensus.

---

## Moderation and Enforcement

Maintainers reserve the right to:

- moderate or close a discussion;
- close an issue or pull request;
- request tone or content modifications;
- limit or suspend access to contributions;

when a behavior harms the project's quality or proper functioning.

These measures may be applied without prior warning in case of manifestly problematic behavior.

---

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces:
- GitHub repository;
- issues and pull requests;
- discussions;
- code reviews.

By participating in the project, you accept these rules.
